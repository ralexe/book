# Debugging on MacOS over SSH

If you are trying to debug a program over SSH, you may experience failures
like rizin getting stuck while opening the file. This is because the OS is
waiting for user authentication before allowing the debugging. However, since
you are over SSH the OS has no way of showing the permission window.

To avoid this problem you can either run rizin with `sudo` or you may
instruct taskport to not authenticate the user by executing the following
commands. This will disable the debugging authentication prompt even after
you reboot.

```sh
security authorizationdb read system.privilege.taskport > taskport.plist
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Set :authenticate-user false' ./taskport.plist
sudo security authorizationdb write system.privilege.taskport < taskport.plist
```
